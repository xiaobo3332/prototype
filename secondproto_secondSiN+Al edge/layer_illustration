2.interface_mmi12.py generate recess, Al and SiN
3.execute2.py merge structures we need to pattern and transform them to correct coordinate position.
4.AlignmentMarkerSet.py generate markers and place them to correct coordinate position.
5.merge.py is to merge structures and alignment markers system.

Ge WG mask
For shorter wavelength(6.76um) combiner: increase length of MMI from [110,110,110, 100,110,120] to [120,120,120, 110,120,130]
For higher coupling efficiency: shrink width from 20um to 10um (right two columns)

Al mask
##### shrink the size of bigsquare from 16.5um to 7um; shrink the size of smallsquare from 11.5um to 3.5um #####
Rik said it's too small to see, delete one row besides end facet
Negative: modify four alignment markers

Al mask + extra pad
1. Add metal pad 2000X460
2. 7um->9um   7.5um->9.5um  in script. But in reality, 9X9  9X9  9X9.5  9X8.5
3. modify eight alignment markers

20211027
Pillar: 180->160um!

SiN: add extra SiN protection pad
